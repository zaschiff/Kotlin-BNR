# KOTLIN-BNR

This is a repository for all work done from the training book:

	Kotlin Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide 
	by David Greenhalgh and Josh Skeen

All projects are written in IDEA development IDE by IntelliJ/Jetbrains.
All code will be in the src folder of each project. They will also have a .kt extension.
All challenges for the book will done in separate labeled branches. They will not be merged into the master branch. 
The master branch will hold the code for the chapter prior to the
challenges. and will end where the chapter ends.

## Sandbox

This is a simple project to understand kotlin's types and variable declaration....

The new file, SimVillage.kt, is a simple file to demonstrate anonymous functions and the function type.

## NyetHack

This project is built at the beginning of chapter 3. It is introduction of control flow with in kotlin.
The reason behind Nyethack, from the book's perspective, is that the project will help develop skills in kotlin
using a text based game similar to the game NetHack from NetHack.org. Since kotlin was designed by Jetbrains and
they have offices in Russia, the game gets renamed to NyetHack.

Chapters 5 and 6 are discussions on Anonymous functions, the Function type, Null, Nullability, handling null values, 
and exceptions. There are no challenges at the end of these chapters. To see work done and notes, please review the files: 

	Tavern.kt
	SwordJuggler.kt

Chapter 9 also has no challenges and therefore nothing to branch. Any notes will be below the code.

# Challenges

challenges are being kept in a separate branch. to view them please review the list section
